Oh!</segment><segment index="5" start="10.56" end="13.96"> And I said all this up, surprised the world's most deserving kids.</segment><segment index="6" start="13.96" end="15.72"> Safety is for losers!</segment><segment index="7" start="15.72" end="16.96"> Yeah!</segment><segment index="8" start="16.96" end="19.76"> I'm importantly three months ago, one of this existed,</segment><segment index="9" start="19.76" end="21.76"> because that's when I reached out to a friend of mine</segment><segment index="10" start="21.76" end="25.64"> who many considered to be the greatest engineer this

start="27.720000000000002" end="30.240000000000002"> I'm planning on throwing the world's greatest birthday party</segment><segment index="14" start="30.240000000000002" end="31.36"> for this kid named Ethan.</segment><segment index="15" start="31.36" end="32.4"> I can explain later.</segment><segment index="16" start="32.4" end="35.16"> For now, I need you know what you've got in the idea.</segment><segment index="17" start="35.16" end="37.4"> Oh, that's a great question, Mark.</segment><segment index="18" start="37.4" end="41.480000000000004"> One time, Furb and I made the world's first rocket-powered tire-swing,</segment><segment index="19" start="41.480000000000004" end="44.2"> you'll just need a tire, you're standard-elemon parts,</segment><segment index="20" start="44.2" end="46.2"> don't forget your high-powered rockets.</segment><segment index="21" start="46.2" end="49.56"> Oh, and as you can see, as long as you don't remove this screw,</segment><segment index="22" start="49.56" end="50.24"> you'll be fine.</segment><segment index="23" start="50.24" end="53.6"> You do realize that brings like seven laws of physics, right?</segment><segment index="24" start="53.6" end="55.8"> Well, we're working with cartoon physics,</segment><segment index="25" start="55.8" end="57.559999999999995"> but I trust you can figure it out.</segment><segment index="26" start="57.559999999999995" end="59.8"> In the meantime, I was thinking Furb and I</segment><segment index="27" start="59.8" end="61.64"> could take a crack at your world record</segment><segment index="28" start="61.64" end="64.32"> breaking elephant toothpaste experiment.</segment><segment index="29" start="64.32" end="67.28"> Ooh, why the heck would we both have our work cut out for us?</segment><segment index="30" start="67.28" end="68.47999999999999"> I'll talk to you later.</segment><segment index="31" start="68.47999999999999" end="70.08"> Now, I knew for personal experience</segment><segment index="32" start="70.08" end="72.84"> if you can pull off a finies-sum Furb invention in real life,</segment><segment index="33" start="72.84" end="74.84"> it makes for a really epic party</segment><segment index="34" start="74.84" end="77.08"> with 15 tons of jello to spare.</segment><segment index="35" start="77.08" end="79.88"> But the problem here was their rocket-powered tire-swing,</segment><segment index="36" start="79.88" end="83.72"> leaned very heavily on the creative boundaries of cartoon physics</segment><segment index="37" start="83.72" end="86.92"> with estimated peak forces that would be 35 times</segment><segment index="38" start="86.92" end="88.28"> when a human could endure.</segment><segment index="39" start="88.28" end="89.24"> So it was the first pass.</segment><segment index="40" start="89.24" end="93.03999999999999"> I just let two rockets with 2,500 Newton-second total impulse</segment><segment index="41" start="93.03999999999999" end="95.48"> to a single chain mounted to a tire-swing,</segment><segment index="42" start="95.48" end="98.76"> and generously gave our 180-pound crash test dummy Newton</segment><segment index="43" start="98.76" end="100.72"> first dibs on the ride of his life.</segment><segment index="44" start="100.72" end="102.36"> Initiator is on.</segment><segment index="45" start="102.36" end="104.16"> This is the test my hypothesis.</segment><segment index="46" start="104.16" end="106.6"> Why finies-sum Furb is an animated show.</segment><segment index="47" start="106.6" end="108.36"> Three, two, one.</segment><segment index="48" start="108.36" end="109.2"> One.</segment><segment index="49" start="109.2" end="110.2"> One.</segment><segment index="50"

end="114.2"> One.</segment><segment index="54" start="114.2" end="120.2"> And after the smoke cleared, we lost our fans.</segment><segment index="55" start="120.2" end="123.44"> That was the most powerful, depancing in history.</segment><segment index="56" start="123.44" end="125.44"> The single chain is going to make it tough.</segment><segment index="57" start="125.44" end="127.48"> So to keep us from immediately spinning out of control,</segment><segment index="58" start="127.48" end="130.48000000000002"> and potentially losing all our dignity in the process,</segment><segment index="59" start="130.48000000000002" end="132.6"> we doubled the chains for more stability.</segment><segment index="60" start="132.6" end="133.6"> Here we go.</segment><segment index="61" start="133.6" end="135.6"> And this time, let it rip.</segment><segment index="62" start="135.6" end="142.6"> The exact same thing happened.</segment><segment index="63" start="142.6" end="143.6"> No.</segment><segment index="64" start="143.6" end="148.6"> He can't keep his clothes on.</segment><segment index="65" start="148.6" end="150.6"> I think only one of them ignited.</segment><segment index="66" start="150.6" end="152.6"> And a high-speed camera replay revealed,</segment><segment index="67" start="152.6" end="154.6"> that's exactly what happened.</segment><segment index="68" start="154.6" end="156.6"> So once we fix the fault to the ignition wire,</segment><segment index="69" start="156.6" end="157.6"> we try it again.</segment><segment index="70" start="157.6" end="158.6"> Go!</segment><segment index="71" start="158.6" end="159.6"> No!</segment><segment index="72" start="159.6" end="161.6"> I can't!</segment><segment index="73" start="161.6" end="163.6"> How's he Newton?</segment><segment index="74" start="164.6" end="166.6"> Which I'll remind you, ways more than I do.</segment><segment index="75" start="166.6" end="168.6"> To launch 10 feet into the air,</segment><segment index="76" start="168.6" end="170.6"> completing the stylish dismount.</segment><segment index="77" start="170.6" end="172.6"> That was definitely both that time.</segment><segment index="78" start="172.6" end="174.6"> It's Tuesday, Ron!</segment><segment index="79" start="174.6" end="175.6"> That's a W.</segment><segment index="80" start="175.6" end="179.6"> And while the dual chain configuration did provide a lot more stability,</segment><segment index="81" start="179.6" end="181.6"> the slow move revealed it was really no way</segment><segment index="82" start="181.6" end="184.6"> to reliably keep the thrust factor aligned in the best direction</segment><segment index="83" start="184.6" end="185.6"> to loop us around.</segment><segment index="84" start="185.6" end="186.6"> This is too squirrely.</segment><segment index="85" start="186.6" end="188.6"> We need to go to rigid chains.</segment><segment index="86" start="188.6" end="191.6"> To fix that, we swapped the two chains with two solid rods.</segment><segment index="87" start="191.6" end="192.6"> Igniteers hot.</segment><segment index="88" start="192.6" end="195.6"> Three, two, one.</segment><segment index="89" start="195.6" end="196.6"> Go!</segment><segment index="90" start="196.6" end="197.6"> Go!</segment><segment index="91"

end="201.6"> Go!</segment><segment index="95" start="201.6" end="204.6"> You can see here, the rocket forces were so high.</segment><segment index="96" start="204.6" end="208.6"> It ripped our entire half-tun steel swing structure out from the stakes,</segment><segment index="97" start="208.6" end="210.6"> anchoring it into the ground.</segment><segment index="98" start="210.6" end="211.6"> That's the-</segment><segment index="99" start="211.6" end="213.6"> You got-you got-</segment><segment index="100" start="213.6" end="215.6"> Alright, well that's a successful rocket swing.</segment><segment index="101" start="215.6" end="218.6"> Now we just got to figure out how to make it slightly more safe.</segment><segment index="102" start="218.6" end="220.6"> So we were off to a promising start.</segment><segment index="103" start="220.6" end="222.6"> We just needed a little more inspiration.</segment><segment index="104" start="222.6" end="223.6"> Hey, Mark, how's the build?</segment><segment index="105" start="223.6" end="227.6"> It's got a little work left, but it's getting less lethal by the minute.</segment><segment index="106" start="227.6" end="230.6"> I do feel, though, that the party needs a little something more.</segment><segment index="107" start="230.6" end="231.6"> I've got it.</segment><segment index="108" start="231.6" end="236.6"> How about your build on my backyard roller culture like the one we made at the beginning of summer?</segment><segment index="109" start="236.6" end="241.6"> Feel tracks, cards, with seat belts, and of course be sure to add extra thermal shielding</segment><segment index="110" start="241.6" end="243.6"> for when you re-enter the atmosphere.</segment><segment index="111" start="243.6" end="246.6"> Aren't you a little young to be building things that require extra thermal shielding</segment><segment index="112" start="246.6" end="248.6"> for when they re-enter the atmosphere?</segment><segment index="113" start="248.6" end="249.6"> Yes, yes I am.</segment><segment index="114" start="249.6" end="250.6"> Well, the block.</segment><segment index="115" start="250.6" end="251.6"> Oh, gotta go.</segment><segment index="116" start="251.6" end="252.6"> Herb just arrived with.</segment><segment index="117" start="252.6" end="254.6"> Oh, our store of the show.</segment><segment index="118" start="254.6" end="257.6"> No, Phineas, you don't need a tiny-</segment><segment index="119" start="257.6" end="258.6"> Tile it, Mark.</segment><segment index="120" start="258.6" end="260.6"> Oh, that's gonna get messy.</segment><segment index="121" start="260.6" end="264.6"> Now the good thing about roller coasters is unlike two story tall rock-a-power tire swings.</segment><segment index="122" start="264.6" end="266.6"> Roller coasters actually exist.</segment><segment index="123" start="266.6" end="271.6"> So I did what any self-respecting engineer would do as a first step and conducted some tedious research.</segment><segment index="124" start="271.6" end="276.6"> Now I knew that finding the perfect Goldilocks zone for our birthday guests would be critical.</segment><segment index="125" start="276.6" end="283.6"> Not so extreme, it sends him back to the hospital, but also not so boring, it feels like watching</segment><segment index="126" start="283.6" end="284.6"> William Austin video.</segment><segment index="127" start="284.6" end="289.6"> So armed with all the learnings from our TES research, we set up to build the perfect indoor roller</segment><segment index="128" start="289.6" end="290.6"> coaster for my buddy Ethan.</segment><segment index="129" start="290.6" end="291.6"> By the way, this is Ethan.</segment><segment index="130" start="291.6" end="296.36"> And when you should know about Ethan, is he was recently diagnosed with a rare and severely</segment><segment index="131" start="296.36" end="300.8"> debilitating neurological condition that left him bedridden, causing him to miss most of his</segment><segment index="132" start="300.8" end="301.8"> school year.</segment><segment index="133" start="301.8" end="305.6"> In fact, his pain in nausea was so severe, he couldn't even walk from one room to another.</segment><segment index="134" start="305.6" end="308.6"> Other thing you should know about Ethan is he's incredibly resilient.</segment><segment index="135" start="308.6" end="311.6"> And after a full year, he'd recovered enough to make his way back to school.</segment><segment index="136" start="311.6" end="312.6"> And his luck would have it.</segment><segment index="137" start="312.6" end="318.08000000000004"> He not only had a birthday party coming up, but he was also a massive finise in Furb fan, which was</segment><segment index="138" start="318.08000000000004" end="322.08000000000004"> perfect because we had our first prototype of the world's greatest finise in Furb indoor roller</segment><segment index="139" start="322.08000000000004" end="323.08000000000004"> coaster ready to test.</segment><segment index="140" start="323.08000000000004" end="325.08000000000004"> OK, man, here we go!</segment><segment index="141" start="325.08000000000004" end="327.08000000000004"> Let's go, let's go!</segment><segment index="142" start="327.08000000000004" end="330.08000000000004"> Oh yeah!</segment><segment index="143" start="330.08000000000004" end="332.6"> I think we're going to have to check our calculations.</segment><segment index="144" start="332.6" end="335.72"> So I called up some of my buddies who are really good at this.</segment><segment index="145" start="335.72" end="339.52000000000004"> And they introduced me to the efficiency of their calculations, why introduce them, to the</segment><segment index="146" start="339.52000000000004" end="349.88"> efficiency of a 10 second build montage.</segment><segment index="147" start="349.88" end="354.24"> And while not yet perfect, we were certainly on the right track.</segment><segment index="148" start="354.24" end="355.96000000000004"> Now we just needed a few more of them.</segment><segment index="149" start="355.96000000000004" end="356.96000000000004"> Good.</segment><segment index="150" start="356.96000000000004" end="359.48"> And things were coming along great, but if I was going to get approval from the world's</segment><segment index="151" start="359.48" end="362.48"> most creative engineer, it would need a little something extra.</segment><segment index="152" start="362.48" end="364.92"> So I took a closer look at their original coaster.</segment><segment index="153" start="364.92" end="368.8"> And while we definitely can't send even to France, we definitely could send them through</segment><segment index="154" start="368.8" end="373.28000000000003"> a steak drop, a mud bucket, and a full-on car wash.</segment><segment index="155" start="373.28000000000003" end="378.28000000000003"> Snakes on a train in 321.</segment><segment index="156" start="378.28000000000003" end="379.28000000000003"> Snakes?</segment><segment index="157" start="379.28000000000003" end="383.12"> This build was elegant.</segment><segment index="158" start="383.12" end="387.48"> Our snakes bearing beautifully with a catapult calibrated mud bath.</segment><segment index="159" start="387.48" end="388.48"> Ah!</segment><segment index="160" start="388.48" end="389.96000000000004"> That's why we're safety classes.</segment><segment index="161" start="389.96000000000004" end="391.36"> Why are you smiling so much?</segment><segment index="162" start="391.36" end="392.36"> You're ready?</segment><segment index="163" start="392.36" end="393.36"> Ah!</segment><segment index="164" start="393.36" end="399.36"> Followed by a cleansing soap scrub, infused with eucalyptus soil, and 40 miles an hour.</segment><segment index="165" start="399.36" end="401.36"> That out of debt.</segment><segment index="166" start="401.36" end="406.76"> They're needed bit of a rinse off, and finally air drying with a gentle breeze.</segment><segment index="167" start="406.76" end="407.76"> OK.</segment><segment index="168" start="407.76" end="408.76"> OK.</segment><segment index="169" start="408.76" end="409.76"> Clean as a whistle.</segment><segment index="170" start="409.76" end="410.76"> Oh, good.</segment><segment index="171" start="410.76" end="414.92"> So now it's both the roller coaster and the rocket's been pretty much ready to go.</segment><segment index="172" start="414.92" end="415.92"> I opted for a check-in.</segment><segment index="173" start="415.92" end="417.28000000000003"> Hey, Mark, how's it going?</segment><segment index="174" start="417.28000000000003" end="419.56"> I mean, it's getting there.</segment><segment index="175" start="419.56" end="422.56"> But how do we really make this the best birthday party ever?</segment><segment index="176" start="422.56" end="423.92"> How about...</segment><segment
