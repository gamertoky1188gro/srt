1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
This is the most epic birthday party ever!

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,600


3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,279
And an indoor sledding hill with axle-slap!

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,560


5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,960
And I said all this up, surprised the world's most deserving kids.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,720


7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
I'm important 3 months ago, one of these existed,

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,760
because that's when I reached out to a friend of mine

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,640


11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,800
Oh, hey, Mark!

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,720
Phidias!

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm planning on throwing the world's greatest birthday party

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,359


15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,399
I can explain later.

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,159
For now, I need you to know what you've got in the idea.

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,399
That's a great question, Mark.

18
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,480


19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,200


20
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200


21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,560
And as you can see, as long as you don't remove this screw,

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,240
You'll be fine.

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,600
You do realize that brings like seven laws of physics, right?

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,799
Well, we're working with cartoon physics,

25
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,559
, , , , , , , , ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

26
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,799
In the meantime, I was thinking Furb and I

27
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,640


28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,319


29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,280
why the hell would we both have our work cut out for us?

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,479
I'll talk to you later.  I'll talk to you later.

31
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,079
Now, I knew for personal experience

32
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,840
if you can pull off a finies-sum Furb invention in real life,

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,840
makes for a really epic party

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,079
15 tonnes de gelée à réserver.

35
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,879


36
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,719


37
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,920


38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,280
When a human could endure.

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,239
So it was the first pass.

40
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:33,039
I just let two rockets with 2,500 Newtons-second total impulse

41
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,480


42
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,760


43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,719


44
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,359


45
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,159
This is the test my hypothesis.

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,599
why finies-sum Furb is an animated show.

47
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,359
Tri,duo,one

48
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,200


49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200


50
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200


51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200


52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200


53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200


54
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,200


55
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,439
That was the most powerful, defencing in history.

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,439


57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,480
So to keep us from immediately spinning out of control,

58
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,480
and potentially losing all our dignity in the process,

59
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,599


60
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,599
Here we go.

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
And this time, let it rip.

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,599


63
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,599
No, no, no, no, no, no.

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,599
He can't keep his clothes on.

65
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,599
i think only one of them ignited.

66
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,599


67
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,599


68
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,599
So once we fix the fault to the ignition wire,

69
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,599


70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,599
Go! Go!

71
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,599
No, no, no, no.

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
I can't! I can't! I can't!

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,599
How's he, Newton?

74
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,599
Which I'll remind you, ways more than I do.

75
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,599


76
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,599
completing the stylish dismount.

77
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,599
That was definitely both that time.

78
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,599
It's Tuesday, Ron!

79
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,599


80
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,599
And while the dual chain configuration did provide a lot more stability,

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599


82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,599


83
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,599


84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,599
This is too squirrely.

85
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,599
We need to go to rigid chains.

86
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,599


87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,599


88
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,599
Tri,duo,one

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,599
Go! Go!

90
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,599
Go! Go!

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,599
Go! Go!

92
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,599
Go! Go!

93
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,599
Go! Go!

94
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,599
Go! Go!

95
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,599
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

96
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,599
It ripped our whole half-tuned steel swing structure out of the stakes,

97
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,599


98
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,599


99
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,599
You got-you got-

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,599
OK, well that's a successful rocket swing.

101
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,599
Now we just gotta figure out how to make it a little safer.

102
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,599
So we were off to a promising start.

103
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,599
We just needed a little more inspiration.

104
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,599
Hey, Mark, how's the build?

105
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,599


106
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,599
I feel, though, that the party needs a little something more.

107
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,599
I got it.

108
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,599
How about building on my backyard roller culture like the one we made at the beginning of summer?

109
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,599


110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,599


111
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,599
♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪

112
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,599
For when they re-enter the atmosphere?

113
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,599
Yes, yes I am.

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,599
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

115
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,599
Oh, I gotta go.

116
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,599
Herb just arrived with.

117
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,599
Our store of the show.

118
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,600
No, Phineas, you don't need a tiny--

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
, Mark.

120
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh, that's gonna get messy.

121
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600


122
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Roller coasters actually exist.

123
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
So I did what any self-respecting engineer would do as a first step and conducted some tedious research.

124
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Now I knew that finding the perfect Goldilocks zone for our birthday guests would be critical.

125
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Not so extreme, it sends him back to the hospital, but also not so boring, it feels like watching

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
William Austin video.

127
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,600
So armed with all the learnings from our TES research, we set up to build the perfect indoor roller

128
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Coaster for my buddy Ethan.

129
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
About the way,this is Ethan.

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,360
And when you should know about Ethan, is he was recently diagnosed with a rare and severely

131
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,800


132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

133
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,600
actually, his pain in nausea was so severe, he couldn't even walk from one room to another.

134
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600


135
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,600
And after a full year, he'd recovered enough to make his way back to school.

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
And his luck would have it.

137
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,080
He not only had a birthday party coming up, but he was also a massive finish in Furb fan, which was

138
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
perfect because we had our first prototype of the world's greatest finish in Furb indoor roller

139
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
coaster ready to test.

140
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Okay, man, here we go!

141
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Let's go, let's go!

142
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,080
Oh yeah!

143
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,600
I think we're gonna have to check our calculations.

144
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,720
So I called some of my buddies who are really good at this.

145
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,520


146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:49,879


147
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,240
And while not yet perfect, we were certainly on the right track.

148
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,960
Now we just needed a few more of them.

149
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Good.  Good.

150
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,480
And things were going along great, but if I was going to get approval from the world's

151
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,480


152
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,920
So I took a closer look at their original coaster.

153
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,800
And while we definitely can't send even to France, we definitely could send them through

154
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,280


155
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,280


156
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

157
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

158
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,480
Our snakes bearing beautifully with a catapult calibrated mud bath.

159
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480


160
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,960
That's why we're safety classes.

161
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,360
Why are you smiling so much?

162
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360


163
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360


164
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,360


165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o

166
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,759
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

167
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,759
Okey.

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,759
Okey.

169
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,759
Clean as a whistle.

170
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,759
Oh, that's good.

171
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,920
So now it's both the roller coaster and the rocket is pretty much ready to go.

172
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
I opted for a check-in.

173
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,280
Hey, Mark, how's it going?

174
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,560
I mean, it's getting there.

175
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
But how do we really make this the best birthday party ever?

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,920
How about...

177
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Swinter.

It's like summer, in winter.It's like summer, in winter.

179
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,920
All you need is a snilco maker and a bunch of jet-powered fans.

180
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,800
But make sure to keep it windows closed.

181
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,399
You really don't want to bring Swinter inside your house.

182
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,399
The news?

183
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,160
You pointed head of genius.

184
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,959
i think you're onto something.

185
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,959
Oh, that's right.

186
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,840

No, no, we don't.

00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,519
OK, see you.

192
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,519
You know that.

193
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,519
Snowing indoors?

194
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,519
I'll make this be.

195
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,759


196
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,680
So I invited out an old friend to help.

197
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Oh, my God.

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,279
This is insane.

199
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,279
Here is Fletcher.

200
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,439
And if you seem familiar to you, that's because five years ago I surprised

201
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:56,159


202
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,479

203
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
The best experiment.

204
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,960
Now, the time fletcher was dealing with a very rare form of brain cancer and since so many

205
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,040


206
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,879
I'm five years free of any signs of disease and I'm a senior in high school that's going

207
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,879


208
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,879
And you're almost as tall as me. And you're almost as tall as me.

209
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,879
I'm gonna say, I'm still taller. I'm gonna say, I'm still taller.

210
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,680
So I explained to him the engineering challenge of creating a non-cart tune indoors.

211
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Snowstorm.

212
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Fletcher was fine.

213
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Let's do it.  Let's do it.

214
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, the problem is I don't know how.

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't have the...

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
With that uninspiring kick-off, we decided to just try some items we had lying around

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000


219
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:46,679
I'm far the last one.

220
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,559
Our first thought was grading styrofoam, but it turns out that's not only dangerous.

221
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,559
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

222
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,559
Just created my finger.

223
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,919


224
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,360
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

225
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,799
But it turns out it's not very good for making so balls.

226
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,799
It's way too slippery.

227
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,799
And I'm gonna pop that.

228
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,039
The amount of diapers required would be half a metric, but which all left us with only

229
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,039


230
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,039


231
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,039


232
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,479
I am being 80,000 pounds of actual ice into a woodchomp.

233
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,839
I think it's going to work.

234
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,839
How's it feel to come in to check things out?

235
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,120
Okay, meat, what do you think?

236
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,840
It didn't take long for Flight sure to let the power go to his hand.

237
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,120
Mark,  ti si dobro?

238
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Yeah, I'm fine.

239
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
But this is good or great.

240
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,720
Now that we had a solution in hand, I need to flex your help on one last finishing touch.

241
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Oh, it was Nathan.

242
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,840
A

243
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
until later.

244
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
What?

245
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Man, this is gonna take a while.

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,480
Much longer now with one person.

247
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,240
We're back in the snow!

248
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Let's go! Let's go!

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,279
4 hours and 40 tons of ice later.

250
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,639


251
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,240
8 months of planning and where it comes down to this moment.

252
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,080
Here he is!

253
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,720
Oh my god, my heart is about to beat out of my chest.

254
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,120
We had either parents tell him he was auditioning for a toy commercial, so he wouldn't

255
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Suspect anything.

256
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,399
We laid eyes on a balloon loaded indoor roller coaster, resting on two feet of fresh

257
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,399


258
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,399
No, no, no, no, no, no.

259
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,399
That's cold.

260
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,799
because he's been catching on fast.

261
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,439
Why is there a crunch load?

262
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:25,439
Nathan.

263
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,439
What's going on, pal?

264
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:28,439
No, no, no, no, no, no.

265
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,439
No, no, no, no, no, no.

266
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:30,439
No, no, no, no, no, no.

267
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:32,439
I thought you might need a coat.

268
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:34,439

Finiessen's firm, probably.

271
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,439
Have you seen the episode where the make the rocket powered swing?

272
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,439
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

273
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,720
Have you seen the episode where they send the roller coaster to space?

274
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

275
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,039
Have you seen the episode Ethan called Swinter?

276
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,879


277
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,879
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,199
This is Finiessen firm in real life.

279
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm throwing you a birthday party today.

280
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
What?

281
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

282
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200


283
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
You know what a banger party needs, Ethan?

284
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
A torta de cumpleaños?

285
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
He doesn't need a cake.

286
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Let's work on a cake.

287
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
You know what it needs, though.

288
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
feel like we should have more people here.

289
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
You have friends you'd like to invite?

290
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

291
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
And that was the cue to send in.

292
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
All of Ethan's best friends.

293
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
As well as his loudest friends.

294
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Ethan is a little sister, which meant that he had an important decision to make.

295
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Ethan, to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to

Ethan, our best to say yes.

297
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Fine, but I have something to say.

298
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
OK,that was from you.

299
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
What do you guys say?

301
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
We started the rocket swing.

302
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

303
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,200


304
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Your 104 days of summer vacation.

305
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,200
We won't look any further because it's here and it's called Camp Crunch Labs.

306
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Camp Crunch Labs

307
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,200
With an eight-week virtual space theme summer camp that jumps to each of the planets in our solar system.

308
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Featuring weekly videos with mega experiments that I do.

309
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,200


310
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200

313
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I'll tell you that usually the Crunch Labs bill boxes where they super fun toy together

316
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
We'll ship them to you every week.

317
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Let's go. Let's go.

318
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,200
So if you want an eight-week summer camp where you could travel the cosmos while learning to

319
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Think like an engineer.

320

324
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Starting first with the rockets.

325
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
You guys wanna see it.

326
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:02,200

328
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
We learned from testing those big rockets.

329
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,200
We gave a lot of smoke.

330
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
But what's your breath?

331
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Which is not ideal for your lungs or your smoke alarm.

332
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,200
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

333
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Which is exactly what you naturally do when you pump your legs on a swing by the way.

334
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Then you can add more and more energy to the swing.

335
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Tell us enough.

336
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Please clear the bar.

338
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

339
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

340
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

341
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

342
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,200
And even with their modifications, he thought suddenly occurred.

343
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
That's a really dangerous.

344
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

345
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Safety is for losers.

346
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

347
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
See you as you with such a tough guy all of a sudden.

348
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
I decided to use Ethan to get a baseline.

349
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Here we go.

350
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Here we go.

351
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Just seeing how high you could swing if you just had to rely on your boring old mussels.

352
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Wow! Wow!

353
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,200


354
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Ethan,

355
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I shrimped.

356
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Now, it was my turn to see what would have been if you added 14,000 RPM of propulsion.

357
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Okay, are you guys ready?

358
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Of course, the number one rule when demoing a potentially disastrous engineering bill that

359
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,200


360
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I've never done this before.

361
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
What do you mean you've never done this before?

362
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
How has he been tested?

363
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
No, no, no, no.

364
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
No, no, no, no.

365
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200


366
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200


367
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh, my God!

368
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200


369
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200


370
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200


371
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200


372
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200


373
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200


374
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200


375
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,200


376
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200


377
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Oh, my God!

378
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
That looks so nauseating.

379
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
ethan, eeeeee eeee!

380
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

381
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,200


382
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
swim to break, starting with some snow cones.

383
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200


384
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
And some snowballs.

385
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,200
However, unfortunately for them, certain habits--

386
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

387
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200


388
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200


389
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200


390
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Headshot!

391
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Who's next?

392
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200


393
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
That was awesome!

394
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Okey! Okey! Okey!

395
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

396
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
And then suddenly, and very undeservedly, I might add.

397
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
I wasn't over my head.

398
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
why is everyone aiming at me?

399
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Ok, je suis ?

400
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Who wants to go sledding?

401
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

402
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200


403
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200


404
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200


405
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
!

406
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Don't hide me!

407
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I thought that was--

408
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Ethan was really encouraging with his friends.

409
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Soya!

410
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
That's when he was in the tackle.

411
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Oh yeah!

412
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Go back!

413
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,200


414
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200


415
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Phoenies and Furbin real life engineering build.

416
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Now up the stakes, Ethan reminded me what their coaster was actually like in the show.

417
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,200


418
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
So if this is really Phoenies Furbin--

419
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200


420
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Oh yeah!

421
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
If this was Phoenies Furbin, it would be a triangle fair fair.

422
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
But I wasn't gonna make Ethan ride solo.

423
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
So I had no choice but to tie up.

424
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I never met Phoenies and Furbin.

425
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Oh yeah!

426
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
This was Phoenies Furbin.

427
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
So I had no choice but to tie up.

428
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
I've never met Ethan or you know this.

429
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Tri!

430
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200


431
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200


432
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Go! Go!

433
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
No, no, no, no.

434
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
No, no, no, no.

435
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
No, no, no, no.

436
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
No, no, no, no.

437
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
No, no, no, no.

438
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
No, no, no, no.

439
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
No, no, no, no.

440
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
No, no, no, no.

441
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
No, no, no, no.

442
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
No, no, no, no.

443
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
No, no, no, no.

444
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
No, no, no, no.

445
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
No, no, no, no.

446
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
And while the stakes were fake,

447
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200


448
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
No, no, no, no.

449
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
No, no, no, no.

450
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
No, no, no, no.

451
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
No, no, no, no.

452
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
That's one of the stuff, of course.

453
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
So Mr. Rizzoff in Science Bob's 20 mile an hour car was.

454
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
No, no, no, no.

455
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
No, no, no, no.

456
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
No, no, no, no.

457
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
No, no, no, no.

458
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
No, no, no, no.

459
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
No, no, no, no.

460
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
No, no, no, no.

461
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,200


462
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Nice and clean.

463
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200


464
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200


465
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
You won't have to shower tonight, at least.

466
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
I doubt that, but um.

467
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
So now that all three of our mentions were tested and Ethan approved.

468
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Thank you. Thank you.

469
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,200


470
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Music

471
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Music

472
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
ethan, et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et et

473
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,200
I didn't pull this off on my own.

474
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
What do you mean?

475
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Hey, friends!

476
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
View what we've done!

477
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,200
No, you know for not relying on Cartoon physics, that looks so fun.

478
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

479
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Now for the elephant toothpaste experiment.

480
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Be sure firm isn't too close.

481
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
...................................................................................................

482
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Wow, it looks like you got a lot of cleaning on your hand.

483
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200


484
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200


485
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
See?

486
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

487
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Bye, Mark.

488
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Sorry, Ethan, but that trick won't work in real life.

489
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
m cleaning up? m cleaning up? m cleaning up?

490
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200


491
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Oh, my God.

492
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
. .

493
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
...................................................................................................

494
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Now that Ethan has been given the best birthday ever,

495
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
why don't join us for the best summer-end.

496
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Space Camp Crunchy-Lat.

497
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,200
8 weeks virtual space theme summer camp designed to help fight that summer

498
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200


499
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Since you got canned crunch locks off top of parents and a kind of a little bit of

500
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
